# iintersection

A genetic algorithm for optimizing traffic intersections using microscopic simulation packages. This repository represents all code written for the research project *Intelligent Intersections: A Computational Approach to Traffic Engineering*.

## Running tests

To run the python tests, create a link to the root directory of this repository that python can access:

```
pip install -e .
```

Then you can run the tests:

```
cd tests
python3 test_iintersection.py
```
